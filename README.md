## Segment Everything: CPU acceleration and promptable applications
### Summary
Every demo doesn't use GPU resources, and they are served on CPU only instances.

### Background
One of the most appealing applications of [Segment Anything Model (SAM)](https://segment-anything.com/) is *Everything*, which detects and segments all objects in an image.
However, it requires 1,024 inferences per a single image, and due to the reason, it is hard to be feasible for service providers who donâ€™t have massive GPU resources.
In order to handle this issue, we re-implemented the Everything algorithm in iterative manner that is better for CPU only environments.
Mostly, we can expect comparable results to the original Everything within 1/5 number of inferences (e.g. 1024 vs 200), and it takes under 10 seconds to search for masks on a `CPU upgrade instance` (8 vCPU, 32GB RAM) of Huggingface space.

We named it `Fast Segment Everything`.
You can run the [DEMO](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Annotation-AI/fast-segment-everything) in HuggingFace Space.

### Applications: Promptable Segmentation
Based on `Fast Segment Everything` algorithm, we built a number of applications for promptable segmentation.: text, image, drawing, and click.

## Person Re-Identification(Re-ID)
Person re-identification(Re-ID) aims at retrieving a person of interest across multiple non-overlapping cameras. We implement Re-ID applications for various situations.
